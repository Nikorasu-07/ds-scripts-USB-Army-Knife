# USB Army Knife - LilyGo T-Dongle S3 DuckyScript Payloads

This repository contains a collection of simple DuckyScript files (.ds) designed and tested for use with the LilyGo T-Dongle S3 running the "USB Army Knife" firmware.

These scripts leverage Human Interface Device (HID) capabilities to inject keystrokes into the target machine, automating various actions.

## Compatibility

**Tested Operating Systems:**

* ✅ **Windows:** These scripts have been specifically tested and confirmed to function correctly on Windows operating systems.

**Untested/Incompatible Operating Systems:**

* ❌ **macOS:** These scripts are **not** designed for macOS and are confirmed **not to work** on this platform due to differences in HID handling and command syntax.
* ⚠️ **Linux:** These scripts have **not** been tested on Linux. However, due to potential differences in HID handling and command syntax compared to Windows, they are **expected not to function** correctly on Linux distributions.

**Important Note:**

These scripts rely on HID injection. Their effectiveness and the specific actions they perform are dependent on the target machine's configuration and security measures. Use these scripts responsibly and only on systems you have explicit permission to test.
